## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the final paper of the Database Fundamentals course. In this paper, we delve into various aspects of database management, focusing particularly on relational databases, relationships, SQL subqueries, sets, stored procedures, and views.

 ## Content Overview
 ```

1. **Relational Database**: This section explores the foundational concepts of relational databases, their structure, and operations.

2. **One-to-One and Many-to-Many Relationships**: Here, we discuss the different types of relationships that can exist between entities in a relational database, with a focus on one-to-one and many-to-many relationships.

3. **SQL Subqueries and Sets**: This section delves into the use of subqueries and sets in SQL, demonstrating their importance in complex query construction and data manipulation.

4. **Stored Procedures**: We examine the concept of stored procedures, their advantages, and how they are used to execute frequently performed operations within the database.
